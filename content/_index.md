I'm a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Konstanz.  

My main research interests include historical phonology, the prosody-syntax interface, and language change.

My PhD dissertation focuses on how prosody influenced morpho-syntactic changes in the early West Germanic languages (supervised by [George Walkden](http://walkden.space) and [Tina BÃ¶gel](https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/boegel/)).  
  In my research, I combine evidence from historical corpora with production experiments in modern varieties of these languages, testing whether patterns observed in the past are also found today.
